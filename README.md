chrome plugin which plays music on browser startup

load the entire repository via chrome extensions by enabling developer options and selecting loadUnpackedExtensions button and when you open Chrome browser again you can see the sound being played in background :D 

Note : sounds present on this project are not mine , all of them are received from other websites , i don't own any content of music .

if you want to replace music you can goahead and replace it with whatever you deem to  use just replace it with same name .
